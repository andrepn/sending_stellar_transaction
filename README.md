# BitGo Coins Team Interview Project for Andrew Noel

Congratulations! You have been given 10 Testnet Stellar Lumens, and your task is to send 8.5 TXLM back to us using the return address and memo id below.

Here's the transaction: https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/abd72d5ce158493c77ae505dfe2dbf4d823cae165bccf9baf54778045692e70e

The address and memo id to send them back to is `GCFW3WDOYTJSKXDUXNV6QVRUP4WF7GAAOBZ3FI37K42OJW65VYSONKG6?memoId=19`.

Oh, you'll also need the private key. That's encrypted in a file called `private-key.gpg` with a passphrase that you'll get via email.

You may find [stellar-sdk](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk) useful, but feel free to use any tools you like.

Good Luck!

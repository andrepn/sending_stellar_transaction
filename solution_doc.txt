Note: I am on an Ubuntu machine

In this doc I will walk through the steps I've taken to solve the challenge question

    1.  private-key decryption

    ->  gpg --passphrase-file decryption-password.txt
        --output stellar_wallet_key.txt --decrypt private-key.pgp

        now later on I can read in my private key from stellar_wallet_key

    2.  connect a node to stellar testnet

        first I find the stellar-core installation instructions here:
        https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/INSTALL.md

        NOTE: This whole exercise could be done without a stellar node but
        setting one up allowed me to be more confident using the api and allowed
        me to verify that I have the correct private key

        There is a docker image I could use or I could use the stellar-sdk
        in my browser but since this is my first time interacting with the stellar network
        I will elect to build it locally following the instructions at the bottom of the
        link

        -> connect to testnet using stellar-core_testnet.cfg

        from inside stellar-core directory run:
        -> stellar-core --conf docs/stellar-core_testnet.cfg new-db
        -> stellar-core --conf docs/stellar-core_testnet.cfg run

        using the following I can see my node is indeed synced
        -> stellar-core --conf docs/stellar-core_testnet.cfg http-command 'info'

        and I am connected to the "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

        from here it is easy to start validation and communicate with my stellar node
        but these things are outside of the scope of the exercise and I will move on

    3.  confirm the correct private key using convert-id

        NOTE: stellar-core --conf docs/stellar-core_testnet.cfg = core

        -> core convert-id //private-key from stellar_wallet_key.txt//

        which gives GBGWMMGBIGD2XFL74F6ZC26UCCZ2NI7CPWKQ34NL5XTATZJMYOUFTQZ4
        and that matches the address given in README so I know I have the correct private key!

    4.  test Horizon api by creating new accounts and sending a transaction

        -> create_new_account.js
        -> check_balance.js
        -> send_transaction_test.js

        NOTE: I also confirmed that the fee will be deducted from the sender

    5.  now send the transaction to the public key in README with memo ID set to 19

        -> send_challenge_tx.js
